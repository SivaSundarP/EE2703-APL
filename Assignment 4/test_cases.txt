Life is like a drop of water on a lotus leaf, unsteady and prone to fall at any time.
The entire world, like a large ocean, is full of uncertainties and suffering,
and one must strive to transcend it by understanding its fleeting nature.
Just as a drop of water falling on a hot iron disappears in an instant,
so too is the fleeting nature of human life.
Everyone in the world is constantly searching for happiness,
but true peace and contentment can only be found by accepting the ephemeral nature of life.

You are about to sacrifice something precious.
The life of a fair maiden,
that you would toss into the fiery forge.
Only so that you may be Lord.
What a horrible thing to ponder.
Your ascendency requires her sacrifice,
whether she wishes it or not.
But how would the Lord, crowned so, be looked upon?
Chosen Tarnished and would-be Lord,
dare to tread the path of true rigor.
Spare the poor girl,
and singe your own flesh in her stead.
If you are prepared to show resolve
and attain Lordship through righteous hardship,
then heed the words of I, Shabriri.
Chosen Tarnished, and would-be Lord.
Descend into the depths, far below the Erdtree Capital.
Seek audience with the Three Fingers
and the flame of frenzy.
If you inherit the flame of frenzy,
your flesh will serve as kindling
and the girl can be spared
...setting you on the righteous path of lordship.
The path of the Lord of Chaos.
Burn the Erdtree to the ground,
and incinerate all that divides and distinguishes.
Ahhh, may chaos take the world!
MAY CHAOS TAKE THE WORLD!
